### Alec Tessarowicz
> _Vikas set up and taught me how to use docker to encapsulate a complex headless server based python algorithmic stock trading system.  He was able to quickly understand the essence of the project, find an efficient solution and teach me how it worked.  It was a pleasure working with him and I look forward to doing so again._

### Soren Solari
> _Vikas works hard, communicates well, and is also a pleasure to engage with. Vikas worked with me for about 2 years as a front-end contractor developing prototypes for highly responsive React based web app with some D3.js components. We interacted both remotely and in person. Vikas is talented developer, capable of learning new material very quickly. I would definitely recommend Vikas to anyone needing a front-end developer._
