title: Credit Default 
---

I've been doing some machine learning.

[FICO][fico] is default metric of financial credibility in the USA. A client demonstrated interest in a [machine learning (ML)][ml] alternative to FICO.

I created a presentation. It includes some research into the fallibility of FICO and a demo of ML prediction of credit worthiness.

I used [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter] for my presentation. It's a convenient way to blend code, text, and visualizations. It is shared using [nbviewer][nbviewer].
