title: Robinhood Experiment 
---

### Backstory

I studied computer science and physics in college, then worked in startups for several years. It was not for me.

I wanted to to pursue my passions: rock climbing and Tabla. I became a software freelancer.

This year (2018), a client hired me to do devops work for his algorithmic trading. This got me interested in the stock market. But I had ZERO knowledge of financial markets.

So I started learning (reading/youtube). So I started experimenting with commission free trades on [robinhood][robinhood]. I started with ~$3700 on August 2nd.

I initially lost money (~30% of my investment, portfolio hit $2000 mid september) to the learning curve.

### Learning Curve Timeline

1. Lose money for 1 month handpicking stocks
2. Build an initial algorithm trading [options][options], continue losing money
3. Tweak algorithm, start breaking even, sell off most of the old stock holdings
4. Feel confident, make a blog post, today!

### September 28th

So here I am. I still have some losing assets from my misguided initial investments. But im getting rid of them, and slowly shifting my entire portfolio over to my algorithm.

Yes yes.....I know the standard advice:
> Invest in an index fund Vikas, you cannot time the market. You are just a stupid kid. Hedgefunds hire PHD's for this shit.

But im a fool-hardy kid. Let's see what I can do. Trial by fire.

Im going to document my journey here. Check back for updates.
