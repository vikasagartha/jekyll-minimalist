KG is a philosopher, not just a ball player. I highly recommend this book.

I admire and miss Kobe, as does KG.

KG hung out with ball boys. They were psyched to meet an idol. They were full of positive energy. Stay humble.

Art transcends culture, politics, age. I climb with all humans. Elitists misses out on positive energy. Climbing friends come and go. Injuries, burnout, depression, finances, sickness, age, parenting ....humans fall into these traps. Psych is precious. Never pass up psych.

I'm uncomfortable writing "KG hung out with ball boys". I've allowed society to link men with molestation in my mind. Disappointing.

Silence. Less is more.

Young KG had a "crew" to protect him. NBA KG found himself alone. He describes sitting alone to write this book. I read this passage in King's Canyon. I was about to solo night session. I was scared. This passage locked me in. Moments alone are opportunities to learn oneself. Meditate. Be alone. You and your conscious.

KG's mother was anti-basketball. My own parents are anti-climbing, anti-my-wife, anti-my-career, anti-my-kid, anti-my-whole-fucking-life.

KG respects his mother, but ultimately follows his heart. I follow my heart.

The big 3 was the counter to double teams. Drop the ego. Swing the ball to the 3rd playmaker. Defense will struggle.

> Anytime you're Black, you got to stand up for other people. Cause Black people know what discrimination is like. And if you're in a position of power, you got to always stand up against discrimination. I'm never gonna sit back and let discrimination happen on my watch. (Charles Barkley)

KG experienced what he calls a "cosmic coincidence" in Chicago. He's watching Jordan + Pippen ballin at a local gym. For reasons unknown, he gets called by a random security guard to play. Isaiah Thomas happens to be witness. He tells KG "you're NBA ready right now". KG forgets his college hoop dreams. He sets his sights on the NBA draft.

Priorities. He's got a game against Jordan the next day. Friend is in the hospital. Stays up all night. He didn't give a fuck about sleep before a big game. I aspire to have the same capacity for loyalty and toughness.

KG's around the clock grind in Chicago is insane. The best to do it put in insane work. Years. Consistency. Grind. It all adds up. I have a strong work ethic, but KG is from another league altogether.

Malik Sealy.....

> Like me, he was about to mess up the matrix. (KG regarding AI)

NBA/NFL + NCAA treat black youth as cash cows. The One-and-done rule is financially motivated.

Basketball players are artists. They should have artistic freedom.

Colleges should compensate athletes.

Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf was Kaepernick before Kaepernick

KG doesn't touch a ball after retirement. He gave The Game everything. No "what ifs". It was both rewarding and painful. He doesn't miss it.

I'd like to stop climbing on those terms.

KG unlocked meditative states without any formal teaching. He learned to separate himself from pain. Enlightenment via trauma.
