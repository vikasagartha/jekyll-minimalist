* I was deeply touched by his bond with Kobe. If you know me, you know how much ive idolized Kobe Bryant.
* KG loved conversing with ball boys. The kids were mega psyched to meet an idol. They were full of positive energy. Lesson...don't look down on people, you miss the chance to receive positive energy. I've felt similarly about climbing culture. If you are elitist, quick to write off gumbies, avoid people of different cultures/politics, etc....you stand to lose positive energy. To me, the art of climbing movement transcends level, culture, politics, etc. I climb with all sorts of humans. I've heard (via 3rd person), "dude, i don't get why Vikas climbs with that guy...". Fine by me, ill take the free psych. When you've climbed long enough, you see climbing friends come and go. Injuries, physical burnout, driving fatigue, depression, workload, sickness, age, parenting responsibilities....humans fall into these traps. Psych is precious. Don't pass up psych.
* I respect Charles Barkley. "Anytime you're Black, you got to stand up for other people. Cause Black people know what discrimination is like. And if you're in a position of power, you got to always stand up against discrimination. I'm never gonna sit back and let discrimination happen on my watch."
* Silence --> Less is more
* KG had "crews" growing up. After he entered the NBA, he found himself alone more often. He paints the image of sitting alone to write his book. I read this passage in King's Canyon, as i was mentally preparing myself for a solo night session. This passage put me in the zone. Moments alone are opportunities to learn about oneself. Similar to meditating and sitting alone with your thoughts.
* KG's mother was very anti basketball. Reminds me of my own parents. KG respects his mother, but ultimately follows his heart. My parents are unsupportive of my life choices. I follow my own heart.
* The purpose of the big 3 was to defeat the double team. If you can swing the ball to a 3rd playmaker, it becomes significantly harder for the defense to adjust. Lesson...how you handle the double team determines your success. Drop the ego, pass the ball.
* KG had a foreshadowing experience while in a Chicago gym. He calls it "Cosmic Coincidence". Gets called down by a security guard to ball against Jordan and Pippen. Isaiah Thomas happens to see it and tells him "you're NBA ready right now"...totally changes KG's outlook on life/college/career.
* Good quote regarding AI: "Like me, he was about to mess up the matrix"
* Priorities. He's got a game against Jordan the next day. Friend is in the hospital. Stays up all night. I like how he didn't give a fuck about sleep before a big game. I wanna look back on my life and know that I carried myself like he did in that moment.
* KG's around the clock grind in Chicago is insane. The best to do it put in insane work. Years. Consistency. Grind. It all adds up. I have a strong work ethic, but KG is from another league altogether. Much respect.
* When he lost Malik...so much pain.
* NBA/NFL + NCAA treat young black men like cash cows. One-and-done rule is financially motivated. Basketball players are artists. They have the right to display their craft on the stage they choose. Colleges should compensate athletes.
* Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf was Kaepernick before Kaepernick
* I liked KG's reasoning for not touching a ball after retirement. He gave the game everything he had. He doesn't miss it. He has no regrets. He laid his body on the line. When it was time to hang it up, he had zero regrets.
* KG seems to have unlocked meditative states of mind without any formal meditation. He learned to separate himself from pain.
